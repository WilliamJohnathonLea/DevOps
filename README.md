# Local DevOps

## Metrics and Tracing
Metrics and Tracing are provided by Prometheus and Tempo. To start the stack, run `docker-compose up -d` from the root of this repo.

To view your metrics and traces you can go to [the local Grafana server](http://localhost:3000) which has Prometheus and Tempo configured as data sources.
